Everything is pretty standard on how to build and run, there is a note under Q5

Q1 and Q2 in ./one-level
	
	Build:
		1) Navigate to ./one-level/os and execute 'make clean' then 'make' to build the OS
		2) Then navigate to ./one-level/apps/example and execute 'make clean' then 'make' to make the tests
	Running:
		We have several tests, to run all tests in succession, execute 'make runall'
		We have 6 tests, to execute tests individually, execute 'make runX' where X = [1,6]

	Files changed:
		./one-level
			/apps
				/example/*
			/include
				/os
					memory_constants.h
					memory.h
					process.h
			/os
				process.c
				memory.c


==========================================================================================================

Q3 and Q4 in ./fork

	Build:
		1) Navigate to ./fork/os and execute 'make clean' then 'make' to build the OS
		2) Then navigate to ./fork/apps/example and execute 'make clean' then 'make' to make the tests
	Run:
		We have one simple test, simply execute 'make run'

	Files changed:
		./fork
			/apps
				/example/*
			/include
				usertraps.h
				/os
					memory_constants.h
					memory.h
					process.h
					traps.h
			/os
				process.c
				memory.c
				usertraps.s

==========================================================================================================

Q5 in ./heap-mgmt

	Build:
		1) Navigate to ./heap-mgmt/os and execute 'make clean' then 'make' to build the OS
		2) Then navigate to ./heap-mgmt/apps/example and execute 'make clean' then 'make' to make the tests
	Run:
		We have one test file, simply execute 'make run'
		This single test file contains 3 different tests

	NOTE: 	Due to the execution order of the program, the program will print that it coalesses some blocks
			before frees one of the children.

	Files changed:
		./fork
			/apps
				/example/*
			/include
				/os
					memory_constants.h
					memory.h
					process.h
					heap.h << we created this file
			/os
				process.c
				memory.c
				heap.c << we created this file
				Makefile
