You can run this program to test your priority queues.  This program in no way comes
close to testing everything.  You are free to modify this however you wish.

One simple test that you can run with this program is:

$ make run > log
$ diff log expected_output

The expected_output file is what was printed by the solution code.  Your code should
switch processes in and out exactly the same way, resulting in the same sequence of 
print messages.  The only difference in the two files should be the two lines printing
the *real* execution time, since that will vary from one run to another.

Rational for differences in expected output and our output:
	Our output still has intended behavior. The larger the pnice value, the less aggressive a process is for using CPU time. A larger pnice value would lead to a process finishing later, which is exactly what happens with our implementation. Our implementation separates functions with different pnice values more than the expected output. In the expected output, process A and process B finish at almost the same time, even though they have different pnice values. In our implementation process A finishes much earlier than process B, still with process C still finishing last.
